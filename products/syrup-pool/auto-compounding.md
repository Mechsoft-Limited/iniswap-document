# Auto INI Syrup Pool

## Stake INI, earn INI!

You've now got two delicious flavors of INI-INI Syrup Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

### What’s the difference between the “Auto INI Pool” and the “Manual INI Pool”? <a href="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your INI tokens to earn more INI tokens.** 

But there are some differences:

**Manual INI**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your INI by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SYRUP Token](syrup-pool-faq.md#whats-syrup-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto INI**

* Stake your INI and forget about it! The INI you stake in this Syrup Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit SYRUP to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto INI Syrup Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee **

* **0.1% if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more INI in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 INI, then 0.02 INI would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The INI collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular INI token burns. 

This is a good thing for INI holders because it reduces the overall amount of INI tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto INI Syrup Pool? <a href="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your INI, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto INI bounty?

**Auto INI Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto INI pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto INI Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of INI you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
