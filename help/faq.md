## How can I stake INI?

You can stake your INI in Iniswap Syrup Pools. Visit the [Syrup Pools page](https://iniswap.finance/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Syrup Pools guide](https://docs.iniswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Syrup Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more INI by supporting iniswap.

Staking only needs some INI to be added to a Syrup Pool to earn INI or other tokens.\
[Learn more about Syrup Pool staking.](https://docs.iniswap.finance/products/syrup-pool)

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn INI.\

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to Iniswap guide](https://docs.iniswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

Join the [announcements Telegram group](https://t.me/PancakeSwapAnn) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on Iniswap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to Iniswap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## Is Iniswap protected from flashloan attacks?

iniswap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. iniswap’s INI token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, INI token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

iniswap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.
