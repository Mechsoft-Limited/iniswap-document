# Controlling INI supply

## Why INI has no hard cap

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of INI token, making it an inflationary token.&#x20;

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the chefs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

> INI's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. _Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity (LP fees etc. would remain)._

**So what are the other ways INI's supply is limited, to counter inflation? **

## How INI supply is reduced without a hard cap

The chefs aim to **makedeflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into iniswap's products**.** The goal is for more INI to leave circulation than the amount of INI that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions&#x20;

By reducing the amount of INI made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.iniswap.finance/#/iniswap/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of INI entering circulation from 40 INI per block to 14.5. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of iniswap's products (like a 10% burn of INI spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way.
