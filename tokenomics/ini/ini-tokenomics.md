## **Emission rate** <a href="emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                                                                | **Emission/block (INI)** | **Emission/day (INI)** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: | ----------------------: |
| Emission                                                                  |                        40 |               1,152,000 |
| Burned Weekly [(PID 138)](INI-tokenomics.md#why-is-the-INI-burn-manual) |                     -25.5 |                -734,400 |
| **Effective Emission**                                                    |               **<14.5\*** |           **371,600\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 INI per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery, and burned (PID 137 - Details below).

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of INI is also [minted to the Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0xceba60280fb0ecd9a5a26a1552b90944770a4a0e#tokentxns) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 INI are harvested, then 9.09 INI is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
All INI minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn and never enters circulation.&#x20;

As such, we haven't included it in the above emission rate.
{% endhint %}

## Distribution <a href="distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to                | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total INI) |           Reward/day |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------: | ------------------------: | -------------------: |
| Farms and Lottery             |                       11.25% |                       4.5 |     129,600 (approx) |
| of which diverted and burned  |                              |                           |              -45,000 |
| Syrup Pools                   |                          25% |                        10 |     288,000 (approx) |
| **Total Daily INI Emission** |                              |                           | **371,600 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
{% endhint %}

As well as the above, INI is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on iniswap V2
* **100%** of INI sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of INI raised in IFOs
* **100%** of INI spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **100%** of INI bid during Farm Auctions
* **20%** of INI spent on lottery tickets
* **45,000** INI per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (_The INI for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
* **3%** of every Prediction markets round is used to buy INI for burning
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto INI Pool
* **2%** of every NFT sale on the NFT Market is used to buy INI for burning

## Why is the INI burn manual?

To hit the ground running, iniswap launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) with the MasterChef contract emitting 40 INI per block. For that reason, the early team didn't add additional functions such as the ability to customize the INI minting logic. As migrating to a new MasterChef would require a lot of time and effort, the team opted to reduce INI emissions instead through a manual burn process by creating two pools:

* Legacy Lottery Pool (PID - 137) - burned INI from the lottery
* Burn Pool (PID - 138) - burned INI per block

These pools work similarly to the farms, where the Chefs can adjust the percentage of the 40 INI per block allocated to it after each INI emission reduction vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On the day of the burn, the supply shown on the homepage might suddenly jump by several million INI.&#x20;

Don't worry -** THIS INI NEVER ACTUALLY ENTERS CIRCULATION:**
{% endhint %}

This apparent jump is just because of how all the INI that's allocated for the burn is stored during the week.&#x20;

The INI sent to both pools PID-137 and PID-138 are harvested before completing the weekly token burns, and this makes the Total Supply shown on the site jumping by \~6M. This is because pending INI isnâ€™t registered in the Total Supply until it's harvested on the burn day. Once the token burn transaction is completed, the \~6M is shown in the Burned to Date.&#x20;

## How to Confirm INI Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating INI supply shown on the iniswap homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the INI token contract on BscScan and [see how much INI is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of INI that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual INI supply.
