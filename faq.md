AMA/QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


# Question 1: 

## Can you briefly introduce yourself as well as Iniswap?

# Answer 1
Hello, everybody I am……., Global Business Director of Iniswap.

Iniswap is a decentralized exchange(DEX) for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. IniSwap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model where users trade against a liquidity pool. Such pools are filled with users’ funds. They deposit them into the pool, receiving liquidity provider (or LP) tokens in return. They can use those tokens to reclaim their share, plus a portion of the trading fees.
Iniswap is devoted to building the best AMM+NFT BSC decentralized exchange for DeFi projects, providing a more friendly trading experience and better project support.
So basically you can do swap, farm, and pool on Iniswap. We provide trade mining, growth funds to projects farming on Iniswap. And we will launch the NFT marketplace and our own NFT series as well as our own Metaverse.
# Question 2

## Why did Iniswap choose BSC (Binance Smart Chain) instead of Ethereum or other network ?
# Answer 2
Iniswap strongly believes that low cost, transaction speed, and accessibility matter.Binance core is “Lead, not follow” which is what we respect.
And no doubt! Binance Smart Chain is the best, with most DeFi projects, the largest DeFi users, the cheapest gas fee, and the fastest transaction speed.
# Question 3: 
## How can Iniswap generate profit/revenue to sustain your project, and what is its business model? How do your investors and projects become a win-win situation?

# Answer 3:
 Just like PancakeSwap, Iniswap provides swap, farms, and pools. As a decentralized exchange, Iniswap profits on the trading fee
Users and investors earn on Iniswap mainly in three ways: Trade Mining, Yield Farms, and Snack Pools:
[Trade Mining]: Swap tokens on Iniswap and get INI as a reward for every trade.

[Farms]: Stake Altcoins-USDT to earn INI. Present APR about 50%-1000%. Pretty juicy!

[Pool]: Stake INI to earn INI. Present APR about 600-700%

# Question 4: 

## We all know that security is really important and valued by users these days. What security mechanisms does Iniswap have to ensure users’ assets do not become targets for hackers? Do you have an audit plan through a third party?

# Answer 4: 

First of all, Iniswap is a decentralized platform. Unlike centralized exchanges, Iniswap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: you have 100% ownership of your tokens, and you can trade directly from your wallet.
Also, our team gets all the security concerns from users. We value your security.
So we have Iniswap passed the CertiK audit process: 
https://www.certik.org/projects/babyswap

And we are an open-source project: https://github.com/babyswap/baby-swap-contract So your funds are safe here.

# Question 5:

## Iniswap is a great project..but we know that sometimes the token gets burned and it increases the token’s value. Does your token have any Coin Burn/BuyBack system, or do you have that plan to increase the value of your token and attract investors to invest?

# Answer 5: 

In our special farm/pool event, 50% trading fee will be buyback to INI, and the other 50% will be exchanged to BNB to provide LP for BABY-BNB.
Meanwhile, these LPs used for INI-BNB will be burned, which means this part of liquidity is locked.
Also, 0.05% of the trading fee of the whole Iniswap will buy back INI and burn every week.
Question 6: 
What is your background and how did you come to the idea to create Iniswap project? Why did you choose the name Iniswap? Does it have special meaning and is there any story behind this name?

# Answer 6:

The name Iniswap comes from our initial reflections and vision.
We believe that Defi ought to be the finance service that is easy for everyone to participate in, for both individual and professional users.
While now the situation is, your capital determines how profitable you are. This makes a threshold for Defi.
New DeFi projects usually lack experience or initial capital, so we position Iniswap as the best Dex and asset management choice for new DeFi projects on Binance Smart Chain.
We hope to offer DeFi projects and INI  users a more easy-to-use platform for trading, coin listing, promoting, and even value growth.

# Question 7:

1% for ILO (Initial Liquidity Offering)
9% will be used for partnership with ecological construction
10% will be used for development

Snack Pool – 20%
# Question 8: 

## What are the main competitive advantages that BabySwap has over other swaps such as Apeswap, Pancakeswap, Sushiswap, Uniswap, etc …?

Our advantages are convenience and low cost.
Except for the basic features as PancakeSwap — swap, farms, and pools, Iniswap also has some innovative optimization and support services, including Trade Mining and NFTs market place.And BNB route is another advantage that makes Iniswap special.
